“CES, the world’s largest technology show, appears to be in jeopardy due to rising COVID-19 
cases in the United States. On Wednesday evening, exhibitor Lenovo announced that it would 
“suspend all on-site activity in Las Vegas,” following announcements from T-Mobile, Amazon, 
Meta, and others that they’d be ditching as well and despite CES organizers’ statements today 
that the show would go on.”
